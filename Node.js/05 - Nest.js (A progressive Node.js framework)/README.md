# Nest.js (A progressive node.js framework)
As mentioned in the [nest.js](https://docs.nestjs.com/) website, Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. 
It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements 
of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).  
Under the hood, Nest makes use of Express, but also, provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries, 
like e.g. Fastify, allowing for easy use of the myriad third-party plugins which are available.  
Nest aims to provide an application architecture out of the box which allows for effortless creation of highly testable, 
scalable, loosely coupled and easily maintainable applications.
>Note: Nest.js is highly influenced by font end frameworks like angular.
